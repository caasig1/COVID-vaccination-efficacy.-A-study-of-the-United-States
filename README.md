# COVID cases and vaccinations in the US: CDC

This repo contains the R project used to create the paper "COVID vaccination efficacy. A study of the United States"

Abstract: The most recent pandemic which started in 2019 has had many controversial events related to its vaccines. Since the vaccine rollout occurred quickly after the pandemic took shape, many had reason to doubt its efficacy. This paper uses data collected by the CDC to compare the percent change in vaccinated population with the the ratio of known COVID-related deathsand cases. The resulting model fitting the data shows a logarithmic relationship between these two rates. Thus, it is imperitive to continue encouraging everythong to become vaccinated as it not only leads to reduced COVID-19 cases, but it reduces the severe outcomes of death from COVID.
